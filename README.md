# KMeans

Basic KMeans clustering using standard libraries

Instructions:

    1. Add space-separated values in a file with a new point on each line
    2. Run "python kmeans.py <file_name> <no_of_clusters_(k)>"
    3. Position of centroids will be stored in clusters.txt

Note:
    The program is meant to demonstrate the KMeans algorithm in a simple and straightforward way. Data preprocessing (incl. feature normalisation), optimisations etc. are not performed.
